      <p>Hello Reader,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Disclaimer: Actual trying to get to know the good, is not a low energy
        pursuit. It&rsquo;s not high energy but its deffo, not low energy.&nbsp;

      <p>
        TL;DR:

        . This is the less risky route.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        There are three types of investing . Value/fundamental investing (
        seeing where something is under or overvalued and either shorting it
        (betting it will go down) or longing/calling it (betting it will go up).
        Technical investing/forex etc (babypips.com is a good shout ) this is
        them fancy charts you think of when you think stocks. I&apos;ve spent a
        month or so going through the exercise on here so I could have a general
        understanding of it, though it&apos;s not my cup of tea as it feels like
        financial astrology (people make money off of it though so hats off to
        them).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there&rsquo;s sentimental investing (other people say this stock
        goes up, therefore it goes up! Usually based off surface-level financial
        reporting or big news)(This is the most read about type of investing to
        the average retail trader) (20% of all trades are done by retail
        traders, which are people like you and me, this has doubled during
        covid!!!)(bad sign, a lot more braindeads on the market)(good for
        publicly traded companies tho, 1 trillion market cap almost doubling )).
        Short term, this is the most likely to make you rich but I can guarantee
        that it&rsquo;s CONSIDERABLY more likely to leave you broke (Getting
        lost in the madness of the crowds: dotcom bubble, tulip craze, 08
        housing crash).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then an arguable fourth, which is a machine learning AI to identify
        patterns but this is for the bigger brain
        honchos/Robo-funds/quantitative hedge funds.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>=============================</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Fundamental analysis is the biggest driver of market returns as most
        investing is fundamental. if you were to gain a very solid understanding
        of fundamental analysis, then you would see the BIGGEST returns as it
        where the TRUE hidden gems are (Think warren buffet).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: We are in a bull market, a massive bull market, everyone and their
        mum is making money off of stocks right now, my 47-year-old Nigerian
        uncle that can just about read was talking to me about how he is bullish
        on TESLA the other day. Many other ways to make money lmao.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I would recommend a course on financial reporting (Cash flow statements,
        balance sheet and income statements), blitzing through a course on
        options/greeks and please please please do general readings about the
        philosophies of big boy investors, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing what
        I&rsquo;ve read.&nbsp;

        that I do recommend. He&rsquo;s deffo getting bummed in white-collar
        prison tho.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>1</strong>
        <strong>.</strong> Try to work for a company you would like to have
        shares in. It makes you more motivated to do the work, you can buy
        shares at a discount also, plus if company valuation skyrockets your
        wages will as well. Rising tides raise all ships!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> Dollar-cost average (DCA) like a dirty bastard.
        &ldquo;Time in the market, beats timing the market&rdquo; is the age-old
        adage. You can&rsquo;t predict shit. The stock market is a type 2
        chaotic system. You&rsquo;d have to be near-omnipotent to predict market
        trends well in advance of institutional traders. (Think how the guy from
        the big short was being investigated by the CIA/FBI, because it was
        legit that boogz what he predicted).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Make money, put it in stocks&hellip; not small
        sums. Split savings in 2/3 into stocks or whatever and then the rest to
        save for emergencies and shit. Luckily or unluckily, the societal
        pressure for us to buy our own houses is like rock bottom. We can afford
        to be more aggressive with our shit because even if its wiped out we
        don&rsquo;t pay rent ðŸ˜­â€¨
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If you&rsquo;re genuine about using this as a vehicle for retirement,
        take it seriously.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        So many of us go to school to get an =&gt; education =&gt; job =&gt;
        money
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The stock market is one of the biggest amplifiers of wealth (with the
        lowest barrier to entry) outside of work. Dump your savings in an ETF.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A banging financial reading, watching and listening list.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve read a few of them and they&apos;re kind of boring-ish. I used
        to read em on the bus to work and tell myself they&apos;re good for me.
        Quite insightful in terms of understanding the economic workings n
        whatnot. Sometimes they prattle on about the same stuff but it&apos;s
        pretty good.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Books have been the most useful thing for me tho personally and the WSB
        Reddit which is 90% bull shit memes and people insulting each other but
        now and then someone says something useful usually a DD (Due diligence)
        or just a financial concept or a trend they&apos;ve noticed and you have
        an a-ha moment and do some independent research around it.&nbsp;

        Read random finance articles and then whenever you come across a word
        you don&apos;t understand looks it up on here and try to read around a
        few applications to commit it to memory, kind of like learning a new

        &nbsp;For memes. Plus, they do solid memes about good stocks. If you
        made an index for the most spoken about stocks in this sub and plot
        against the time you beat the market (a good thing) (DJIA/S&amp;P 500 is
        usually alluded to as the market )

        Most of the people on WSB best use leverage (borrowed money) and trade
        using options/CFD (trading financial contracts as opposed to actual
        assets). It&apos;s kind of confusing but it&apos;s one of them ones
        where you keep reading even if u don&apos;t understand and eventually u
        do lol

        But yeah that was a few years of vaguely following finance and a bit of
        dedicated study condensed. Not sure if it&rsquo;s gonna be very helpful
        but I hope it is.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Note: mentioned Tesla earlier. I&apos;m bullish. EV is the future.
        Solid-state batteries are coming and Li-on formulae are being refined,
        energy will be cheaper, greener and cleaner than ever. Exciting times.
        Fun facts 100 years ago most cars were EVs.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Note: Crypto&hellip; I&apos;m kind of bullish? 2 notes to this. 1.
        Blockchain, 2. currency 3. Economics?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        1. Blockchain is a distributed ledger. A decentralised, immutable store
        of information. Very useful in certain places, arguable even
        revolutionary. (Think storing non-sensitive government records to keep
        track of the flow of money ðŸ˜µ goodbye tax evasion) (other implications
        which are scary as it can be used in others ways). That being said it is
        severely overhyped
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        2. as an alternate currency, it sucks. A good currency should have 3
        factors. The medium of exchange, store of value, measure of value.
        Crypto completely fail as a store of value, not a great measure of value
        due to fluctuation, and the bitcoin hash only support 500k exchanges
        meaning it will be limited ( and require 2nd layer solutions to be
        adopted as a currency )
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        3. That being said, keeping a small amount of BTC wouldn&rsquo;t hurt
        :)&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>All of this being said, I still kinda know jack.</strong>
