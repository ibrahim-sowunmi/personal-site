        for a total of about 18 quid an annum or triple the costs and host it

        to me. A beer a month or an AWS EC2 nano instance? <strike>A beer obviously</strike> Beer is haram.

        Hello Reader,<br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>I've decided to start blogging.</b> An absolutely fruitless endeavour
        akin to screaming in the wind, but anyone who knows me well knows that
        engaging in fruitless endeavours has become something of a passion of
        late. Especially as I’m about to enter the work world "for real for real",
        I don’t want to be a passionless bozo. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The decision to try a bunch of random stuff. Such as blogging, has been triggered by
        expendable income, irrespective of that I’ve always been a bit of a
        curious cat. This mindset has led to many poor social and financial
        decisions but we move.
        Okay! Enough rambling!<b> Why am I doing this? </b> <br></br>
        <br></br>It's primarily to tame section a little of this highly centralised beast
        known as the internet (pronounced intahnet) and make it my own. I wanted something similar to
        social media but not as likely to suck me in and a little more fun to curate/create. The solution is
        obviously to build it yourself. I also wanted something more extensible
        than medium and more fun than Wordpress. It’s also a little bit
        of a testament to my technical vanity ngl (or maybe a calling to get a
        life).<br></br>
        <br></br>The current state of the site is a static webpage. This is not the ideal end state but alas I am too lazy to spin up an EC2 to host (and too cheap).  as I’m dilly
        dallying doing this little thing called a degree. <b>EDIT:</b> degree done will move to EC2 when bored.<br></br>

        <br></br>Looking at things people have produced online is not something
        one would traditionally classify as a passion but it's something that I
        and most people, do a lot. It’s pretty much compulsive at this stage.
        Paired with guide my guiding philosophy for life, (connection
        and production (logotherapy - Viktor E Frankl)) it's made me want to share some. <br></br>
        <br></br>I do a solid amount of journaling, tons of note taking. Doing
        it in a manner that isn’t as Blaise as my journal or academic as my
        notes strikes a healthy balance to me. <br></br>

          The intention is to do a post a week of 250 - 500 words, on any topic
          that tickles my fancy really. It’s one those things that should make
          me a better person?

          Edit: Failed this horrendously, second try now (2/11/21)!
