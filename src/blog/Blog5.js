      <h2>The CV guide I wish I had - 13/12/21</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <br></br>
      <p>Hello Reader,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Imagine this. You’re 18. You have no experience and what feels like no
        skills. You’re flung into an environment ­­where, unbeknownst to many
        people, you’re building the foundation for the rest of your life. Well
        what do you do?<p>&nbsp;</p>This dude says get some experience... That
        dude said build a CV... That other other dude said leverage your
        network? The f*** does that even mean? It is confusing. Fortunately,
        you’ve got a lot of time to think and a good head on your shoulders.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Unfortunately, I can’t help with all of that. My expertise is very
        limited. One area which I’ve put a fair amount of energy on is the CV
        building aspect, and below I aim to build & share a solid, if not
        somewhat superficial, resource.<p>&nbsp;</p> There are a few things I
        will be talking about. Industry/Role specificity, CV length, structure,
        format, CV presentation, Value-adding statements, skills, interests,
        experience and Recruiter heat gazes. <p>&nbsp;</p> An ideal CV is 1
        page. Chockablock full of punchy statements, and buzz words relevant to
        the role/industry you're going for. No worries if it’s not great from
        the first draft. Your CV is something that must be nurtured throughout
        your life. It starts with odd jobs and filler. Then you get more
        relevant work. Less filler. Then even more relevant work and experience.{' '}
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </p>
      <h4>Industry/Role specificity</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        When applying for a role in a given industry. There will be industry
        standards. A certain format of CV that is most commonly used. Some will
        be two pages, some will be one page. It’s best practice to conform to
        these. I’m an advocate of keeping a CV short and sweet. If you are an
        undergraduate odds are most of your experience will be filler. You
        should be able to convey all necessary information on 1 page. Maybe two.
        It’s better to have a concise CV and invest energy in a cover
        letter(Adding a cover letter makes you stand out) and making sure every
        line of your CV adds value. <p>&nbsp;</p>The role takes precedence over
        the industry. If you’re applying for a tech role you want a “Techie” CV
        even if that role is within the arts for example. Although sprinkling
        some sauce on the CV by industry will help you stand out. Say for
        instance you're applying for a marketing job in Tech. Demonstrating a
        love for technology will help your case. <p>&nbsp;</p>Tangentially
        relevant experience is also very helpful. If I’m applying for a
        customer-facing role having experience in sales/marketing would be
        useful. If I’m applying for a marketing role experience with event
        planning or working with social media campaigns would be relevant. Tech
        roles need code and could potentially benefit from a customer-facing
        role, depending on the flavour of the industry you’re applying for.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </p>
      <h4>CV Length, Structure & Presentation</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The ideal CV is 1 – 2 pages. Use narrow margins to get as much
        information on the page as possible. Your name should be large at the
        top. Remember to include your contact info. <p>&nbsp;</p>There is no
        need to do, (phone number: 07931700XXX), just write your phone number.
        The reader will be able to recognise what a phone number is. The same
        goes for email, etc. <p>&nbsp;</p>Exclude your physical address. Items
        should be in reverse chronological order (Most recent at the top) for
        the experience section. For the Skills & interests section, the sexiest
        and most relevant should be at the top. <p>&nbsp;</p>When formatting
        utilise everything. Headings, bullet posts, Bolding, etc. Ensure your CV
        is a PDF, as different machines can mess up the displaying of word files
        depending on the software used to open the file.<p>&nbsp;</p>
      </p>
      <h4>Value-adding statements</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Every line of your CV in the experience or extracurricular section
        should have "punch". By that I mean when it’s read it should demonstrate
        what you have done, learnt, gained, etc. If you can throw a buzzword in
        there, brilliant. If not, no worries. You just want it to be clear and
        readable. A layperson should be able to pick up your CV and not want to
        roll their eyes when reading. <p>&nbsp;</p>There should be a clear
        "Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z" flow to every statement.
        Start with an action verb, numerically measure the accomplishment, and
        detail what you did to achieve this.<p>&nbsp;</p> Example: Worked as a
        food server in catering Becomes: Handled large volumes of food, serving
        hundreds, over the busiest weekend in December. <p>&nbsp;</p>I
        intentionally picked a shitty example and kind of overworded it to show
        that it’s not a strict rule. Just a means of conveying a sense of
        accomplishment over simpler statements. <p>&nbsp;</p>Example: Attended a
        sustainability hackathon Becomes: Created a sustainability app in 24
        hours by managing a team of interdisciplinary students. <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Again not the greatest example, although I hope it conveys a general
        feel for what’s good. When creating these statements, there should be a
        focus on metrics/impacts. Ideally related to the role you’re going for.
        If a project manager role, skills conveying time management abilities
        etc.<p>&nbsp;</p>
      </p>
      <h4>Skills, Interests & Extracurricular experience</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This is an interesting section as it has a huge amount of flexibility.
        When adding things to this section take skills that show a proximal
        ability to a given area. Or that show aptitude. This should be
        relatively easy to fill out. A weekend of diligent study in an area
        should give you the ability to add it to this section. <p>&nbsp;</p>A
        quick way to add to this section is to get involved. That may be in
        several places
        <div align="center">
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
            <li>Campus</li>
            <li>Societies</li>
            <li>Club</li>
            <li>Volunteering</li>
            <li>Hosting own workshops (Educational, Artistic, etc)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> When engaging in this try to highlight leadership roles or
        roles that relate to a specific job you are applying for. If you’re
        applying for a banking job saying you were the chair of finance for
        instance.<p>&nbsp;</p> Mention awards and accolades if you have any. If
        you’re CV desperately needs padding, add your Duke of Edinburgh bronze
        award or your engagement with NCS. <p>&nbsp;</p>Finally, add relevant
        skills (These are easy ones to develop beginner proficiency with also):
        Programming with X language Building prototypes with Sketch Managing
        mail campaign with MailChimp Microsoft word, excel, PowerPoint Windows
        operation system, Linux OS, Mac OS Add things like
        speaking/understanding multiple languages or whatever comes to mind as a
        relevant ability. <p>&nbsp;</p>If you want to add hobbies/interests make
        sure that the hobbies and interests you add display desirable traits.
        Captain of the football team (Shows leadership/organisation),
        Programming with X language (Then elaborate with a use case). When
        adding a point here think about the “So what Value”. Imagine if a
        recruiter were to read it. What does it tell the recruiter about you?
        That is the so what value.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Recruiter heat gaze</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        When recruiters look at a CV they scan it. They spend on average 7
        seconds on it. They don’t read it the way you or I would. They parse it
        for catchy statements and buzzwords. They spend a few seconds looking at
        it before determining whether or not it’s destined for the trash can.
        Firstly they look at your name. You want it at the top in big, bold, and
        legible font. No photos. This won’t help you at all. Then they probably
        jump to your experience and look for big names and buzz words. If there
        aren’t any. No worries. You’re a student (probably), if you have these
        it’s a luxury. You can pad these in somewhere with something else
        potentially. Dates are something they regularly check, but as mentioned
        earlier you’re a student. Try not to put anything on there that’s
        greater than five years old!
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>I’ve got no experience/relevant experience! Help?</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This is a tough one. A regular position for a lot of young people to
        start out in. Do these in any order: <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div align="center">
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
            <li>
              {' '}
              o Relevant coursework/projects (This includes Uni work, although
              non-Uni work would be better as it shows some initiative!).{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              {' '}
              o Skills you’ve developed although it’s not a prerequisite for
              work experience tied to be tied to it
            </li>
            <li> o Use bullet points to pad out your resumes structure </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                o For instance for each course you’ve worked through, come up
                with 2 – 3 bullet points for each achievement/accomplishment
                you’ve made in the course.{' '}
              </li>
              <li>
                o A project alone can account for 1/6 of resume space, although
                try not to do this){' '}
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              {' '}
              o START VOLUNTEERING (This is hands down the easiest way to get
              experience), walk to a stall or a chairty shop and ask how can I
              help.{' '}
            </li>
            <li> o Extracurricular activities</li>
            <li> o Certifications</li>
            <li> o Skills </li>
            <li>
              {' '}
              o Any minimum wage low skill job (Retail, Hospitality, agency
              work){' '}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>If after all of this, there’s still nothing. You’re the
        problem. Get of your ass. Do something. Things to do on your ass:
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div align="center">
          <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
            <li>
              Certifications ( E.g., Basic programming skills – You DO NOT have
              to be smart for this)
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects ( Art, Music, Video editing, Critiquing anime videos,
              Video game analysis, honestly anything, just show you have some
              passion and a willingness to learn)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Things to do off your ass, have been mentioned above. If there is no

        If you’re interested in tech related resources (Example CVs, anecdotal
        stories) HMU and will share.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        P.S. When doing the job hunt it's useful to keep a document of where you
        applied for, the requirements, why you were/are a fit for the job etc.
        If you have to repeat the hunt you have a list of potential places.{' '}
