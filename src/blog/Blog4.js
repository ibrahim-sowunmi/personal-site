      <h2>You are what you consume - 31/10/21</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <br></br>
      <p>Hello Reader,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I never thought of myself as a social media addict, but COVID shook that
        belief a little. Suddenly, cooped up at home for months, ‚Äúreal life
        time‚Äù with friends was replaced with virtual time on Twitter, Youtube
        (The commentsüò≠), Reddit, etc. As time went on, I became more aware of
        the insidiousness of what was happening to me. By spending all day
        scrolling, swiping, commenting, I was becoming what I consume, what I
        was paying attention to. This has a huge impact on the way I think. The
        common phrase ‚ÄúYou are what you eat‚Äù is quite relevant here, and in 2021
        is more: You are what you consume.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>A little background I‚Äôve been an occasional Reddit user for
        a few years now. I started using it in around year 11 and what attracted
        me to it were the communities. I really felt like anything I was
        interested in was on Reddit. In a way, I loved gaining knowledge from it
        ‚Äì back then, for my 16 year old brain, it was a goldmine of information.
        I found awesome books to read. Thanks to r/Fitness and r/bodybuilding, I
        started lifting. I learned how to build a computer (and built myself
        one!). I learned tips and tricks to better myself. For the most part,
        I‚Äôd say the early parts of my time on Reddit shaped my life in a
        positive way. In retrospect, it makes sense. I visited positive
        communities, geared towards certain hobbies.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>A few years in, however, I realized that things I was
        reading on Reddit were also things I was reading in real life. I would
        spout out opinions of celebrities from other Redditor opinions I would
        read on online. I started getting a lot of my news from Reddit, and it
        became one of my main news sources. However, the comment sections
        quickly became increasingly partisan and negative, and it was quite
        noticeable. And in turn, I noticed my own thoughts and views on certain
        things become negative without me even having my own reasoning behind
        why.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Popular social media applications on an iPhone These little unassuming
        icons have trapped billions of eyeballs. The problem Last year‚Äôs
        explosive amalgamation of social and political issues laid bare the
        evidence of people ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù what they consume. The algorithmic
        personalization today has led to the creation of insular echo chambers
        for people. People that become stuck in these echo chambers consume
        content streamlined in the addicting nature of having one‚Äôs priors
        confirmed. The feeling of confirmation bias, the feeling of ‚Äúaha! I was
        and am right, and all these people agree!‚Äù floods your brain with
        dopamine. While extremism has grown more rampant over the years, 2020
        laid it all out in the open, pushing people into their echo chambers
        more and retreating from differing ideas with harsh dogma.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Of course, most people aren‚Äôt extremists, as that defeats the purpose of
        the word. But extremism is not just unattractive to most people, but
        also dangerous. Eyes quickly turned to sites like Facebook and Twitter
        as hubs of negative partisanship and toxicity. Of course, this isn‚Äôt
        just relating to political issues, but literally any issue out there.
        Even things like basketball players (Who is the GOAT in basketball?
        LeBron James or Michael Jordan?) have diehard stans and constant haters.
        Negativity runs rampant across these platforms. Even Reddit has become a
        lot more negative, with negative political partisanship penetrating even
        the most unrelated subjects.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Mental health is only getting worse. Negativity is exhausting. Optimists
        live longer. This may be an underlying theme in the fast growth of
        platforms like TikTok and Pinterest, which have done a fantastic job
        moderating away negativity from the masses. It‚Äôs well-known that fear
        generates clicks and it‚Äôs the reason ‚Äúdoom-scrolling‚Äù is a prominent
        action on platforms like Twitter. Furthermore, engagement is king in
        today‚Äôs Internet landscape, and negativity simply generates more of it.
        It‚Äôs a problem that I won‚Äôt pretend to have the solution to for
        everyone, but I do have a few helpful tips to help myself (and you) be a
        healthier online consumer.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        The solution
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Zero-tolerance policy for negativity </strong>‚Äì I‚Äôve
              started aggressively blocking and muting channels, people, and
              accounts that are distinctly negative for the sake of being
              negative. Negativity and/or things I disagree with are not
              inherently bad if they prompt me to think deeper about something
              or force me to consider a new viewpoint that I haven‚Äôt thought of
              before. However, I curate my feed carefully ‚Äì negaholics and
              stupid, unfactual arguments are blocked as a rule.
            </p>
          </li>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Proper social media diet portion sizes </strong>‚Äì
              Reducing my total social media time is a difficult proposition.
              Little tidbits of consumption throughout the day are hard to stay
              away from. However, I can limit time spent by app. I‚Äôve found that
              my TikTok and Instagram feeds are more geared towards humor and
              awe (positive!), so I give myself more time to visit them over
              something like Twitter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Distract yourself from social media </strong>‚Äì Generally
              for me, I have a lot of things I want to do, but not enough time
              for them. Getting started is hard. Without delving into a post on
              ‚Äúhow to beat procrastination,‚Äù I‚Äôve found that once I‚Äôve started
              on a project, it keeps my attention for longer than social media.
              Plus, it‚Äôs immensely more satisfying.
            </p>
          </li>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Help your algorithm out </strong>‚Äì I‚Äôve started
              aggressively blocking and muting channels, people, and accounts
              that are distinctly negative for the sake of being negative.
              Negativity and/or things I disagree with are not inherently bad if
              they prompt me to think deeper about something or force me to
              consider a new viewpoint that I haven‚Äôt thought of before.
              However, I curate my feed carefully ‚Äì negaholics and stupid,
              unfactual arguments are blocked as a rule.
            </p>
          </li>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Go outside </strong>‚Äì People in love nature. It's
              hardwired into our brain to have an appreciation for it. I‚Äôm as
              city as they come but unplugging for even a weekend is very
              freeing.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Curating your online consumption isn‚Äôt easy. It feels counterintuitive
        and petty (can a few posts I read online really affect how I think?),
        but in today‚Äôs online world, it feels absolutely necessary, especially
        as time spent on phones is only going up. You are what you eat,
        physically. And mentally, you are what you consume.
