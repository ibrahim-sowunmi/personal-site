      <h2>SEO Ranking for - 10/01/21</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <br></br>
      <p>Hello Reader,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I have a problem. After building this website I wanted it to be
        google‚Äôable. I want someone to be able type my name and that very first
        link to be my personal site.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <img alt="ibrahim sowunmi seo ranking" src={img1} />
      <p>
        As it currently stands, I don‚Äôt even come up in the first 10 links and
        my link actually comes up on the second bloody page! (95% of traffic is
        on the first page)
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Google has a very intelligent algorithm (googlebot) that trawls and
        indexes the whole of the light web (the part of the web accessible by
        google without authentication)! We want this algorithm to place my
        website with a higher ranking. Please, Serg &amp; Larry!
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How do I fix this? SEO.</b> ‚ÄúSearch engine optimization‚Äù, improving
        my site to increase its visibility to the algorithm. Awesome, so how do
        I improve this? I wasn‚Äôt really sure. So I googled tools to measure the
        SEO-ability of my site
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <img alt="ibrahim sowunmi lighthouse score first time" src={img2} />
      <p>Higher than I expected but still pretty low</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Google lighthouse, was one of the first I came across. Surprising, the
        website performed pretty well. I got a 92 for SEO? So, this tool clearly
        sucks. But, alas, I'm lazy and it's the best I've got üòî
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        My site it static. So, I can‚Äôt use any server-side rendering (no
        server). Client-side rendering and prerendering (sometimes uses a
        server, idk?) are my only options. I‚Äôve never thought about SEO before
        in all honesty, so it was in interesting search. Learning about those 3
        terms in the context of SEO.
      </p>
      <p>¬†</p>
      <p>So how will I attempt to do this?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prerender with react-snap. Initially I
        added a react helmet to all my components briefly outlining their
        function. React helmet allows you to set metadata (title, author,
        description) for my react components. Then I thought about the way SPA
        (Single page web apps) are loaded (sometimes multiple components at
        once) and figured something wasn‚Äôt right (multiple heads at once???).
        After sometime spent researching I realised if I‚Äôm not doing SSR (Server
        side rendering) then there isn‚Äôt much point to react-helmet. So
        prerendering with react-snap it is!
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quality backlinks. The idea for
        PageRank ‚Äî Google‚Äôs early ranking algorithm ‚Äî stemmed from Einstein.
        Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed
        how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the
        theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote ‚Äî the
        more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they
        downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they
        could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and
        rank them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They realized that because of links, the Internet could be analysed and
        ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could
        use links. So, they set about attempting to ‚Äúdownload‚Äù (or crawl) the
        entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The
        sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if
        you did a search for ‚Äúuniversity,‚Äù they could look at the pages that
        talked about ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù and rank them. Pretty cool story.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        So, I pasted my URL perfectly into LinkedIn, Github &amp; Medium.
        Fingers crossed.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        3)I thought the name of your domain was relevant but I was very wrong
        unfortunately... <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The name of your domain
        has zero effect on SEO ranking. To ensure quality rises to the top
        rather than matching domains. Dammit!
      </p>

      <img alt="ibrahim sowunmi lighthouse sail test 2" src={img3} />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Runnng the test again locally absolutely bombed performance (last test
        was on AWS) but accessibility and SEO are way up.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If googleing ‚ÄúIbrahim Sowunmi‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt have a much higher result after
        the next google bot indexing, then my SPA SEO woes will have to be on
        hold until, next year.
