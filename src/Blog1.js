        Hello Reader,<br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>I've decided to start blogging.</b> An absolutely fruitless endeavour
        akin to screaming in the wind, but anyone who knows me well knows that
        engaging in fruitless endeavours has become something of a passion of
        late. Especially as I’m about to enter the work world for real for real,
        I don’t want to be a passionless bozo. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The decision to try a bunch of random stuff has mainly been triggered by
        expendable income, irrespective of that I’ve always been a bit of a
        curious cat. Nonetheless this has led me down, so many poor financial
        decisions it actually hurts me a bit (All in the name of progress).
        Okay! Enough rambling!<b> Why am I doing this? </b> <br></br>
        <br></br>It's primarily to tame section a little of this wild beak the
        known as internet (pronounced intahnet) and make it my own. Similar to
        social media but not as likely to suck me in and a little more fun to curate. The solution is
        obviously to build it yourself. I also wanted something more extensible
        than medium and not as cumbersome as Wordpress. It’s also a little bit
        of a testament to my technical vanity ngl (or maybe a calling to get a
        life).<br></br>
        <br></br>The current state of the site, as a static webpage, most
        definitely is not that but realising that functionality is not a
        difficult task, just one that I am too lazy to implement, as I’m dilly
        dallying doing this little thing called a degree. <br></br>

          2) provide insight into thoughts my for whatever poor soul wishes that
          upon themselves <br></br>3) share some of my photos/art/cool shit{" "}
          <br></br>4) Provide a sort of digital vetting <br></br>5) Finally to
          regain some personal agency over my own data.

        <br></br>Looking at things people have produced online is not something
        one would traditionally classify as a passion but it's something that I
        and most people, do a lot. It’s pretty much compulsive at this stage.
        Paired with guide my guiding philosophy for life, shy of (connection
        and production (logotherapy)) it's made me want to share some. <br></br>
        <br></br>I do a solid amount of journaling, tons of note taking. Doing
        it in a manner that isn’t as Blaise as my journal or academic as my
        notes strikes a healthy balance to me. <br></br>

          The intention is to do a post a week of 250 - 500 words, on any topic
